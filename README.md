# Data-Science-Nanodegree

This repo contains the projects for the purpose of Data Science Nanodegree from Udacity. There are 5 projects:

1. [Fiding Donors](/Fiding Donors/README.md) - In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.

2. [Flower Image](/Flower Image Classifier/README.md) - This project builds a flower image classifier using PyTorch. A few pre-trained network structures are built with pretrained network, and classification layers are trained to classify 102 species of flowers. The model is flexible in that it allows 

3. [Customer Segmentation](/Customer Segmentation/README.md) - In this project, 

4. [AirBnb Data Analysis](/AirBnB Data Analysis/README.md) - In this project, we deep dive into the Airbnb data for Washington D.C. to see if we can gain any insight. As the capital of the United States, D.C. has been attracting a lot of re-development. In fact, Amazon announced recently that they will have the second head-quarter in Northen Virginia, which is just a several miles away into DC. The purpsoe of this project is to understand and demonstrate how CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) can be applied in this type of analysis.

5. [Disaster Response Pipelines](/Disaster Response Pipelines/README.md) - During disasters, there are many communications and messages regarding the needs of people affected by the disaster. Keyword search can be used to find out the exact needs, but it is time consuming when organizations have least capacity to handle, and it can be misleading. For example, keyword "water" does not necessarily indicate the need of water, alternatively, keyword "thirsty" could actually indicate the need of drinking water. In this project, we build supervised machine learning models to accurately categorize the messages during disasters.

6. [Recommendations with IBM](/Recommendations with IBM/README.md) - 

7. [Capstone Project](/Capstone Project/README.md) - In this project, we will analyze the (realistic) data of (fictious) online music app called Sparklify and predict the churn using Spark.
