# Customer Segmentation Project
In this project, we apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

# File Structures
The files are structured as follows:
```
- finding_donors.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis
- README.md
```

# Results and Analysis
First, we cluster general population of Germany into clusters. We applied the k-means algorithm and elbow method to determine the number of clusters. Below is the average distance of data points as the number of clusters increases.

From this, we determine that the number of clusters is 10 (this is debatable as the "elbow" is not very clear).
