# Recommendation with IBM
In this project, we build recommendation engines using the real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. There are following 2 data sets:

- User interaction data: which user (anonymous email id) accessed which article (title and article id)
- Content data: information about the article(article name, article description etc).

Below is the glance into the data set
