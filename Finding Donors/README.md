# Finding Donors Project
This project is completed as a part of Data Science Nanodegree Program. In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.

# File Structures
The files are structured as follows:
```
- finding_donors.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis
- README.md
```

# Results
We employed 3 machine leanring models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). Among these 3 algorithms, Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) algorithm turned out to achive the best performance. 

We further optimize the GBT model by tuning the hyperparameters and the results are as follows.


We then looked at importance of features.
